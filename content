Mother: 
Misty is a mother of three boys and one girl.  If you asked her what her favorite job is or ever has been, she would tell you 
that it is being a mother.  While handling a pack of four can be stressful, Misty enjoys watching her children learn and play.
She takes great pride and receives much pleasure from teaching them as well, even though it can be tough juggling four different
personalities. 
Hairstylist: 
Misty has been a hairstylist for five years.  She enjoys enhancing peoples beauty and making people feel better about themselves.
Likes: 
Misty loves to talk on the telephone and stay in touch with friends and family.  The only thing she likes more than talking on the
phone with them is being with them.  This makes birthday parties and holidays another thing that she immensely enjoys.  Also, Misty
loves to shop.
Dislikes:
Misty is not a cold weather person, therefore snow is one of her biggest dislikes.  Dishes and laundry rank at the top of the dislike
list as well, being as there is six people to contribute dirty dishes and laundry.
